# tik-tac-toe
## Description
Using React to build a tik-tac-toe game. Board is as the parent component, and the buttons and players are the child components. 
Eventaully the javascript will check the pattern and announce the winner. 
## How to Run
- Start your browser
- Click the button on the board
- Start to play!
## Roadmap of Future Improvement
- Let player insert their name. Instead of showing Player 0 and Player 1, it will reflect to player's name. In order to implement that, I will use a useState with an If statement to let the grab player's name in an array. 
- Have a winner counter for each round. In order to implement that, I will have a state to start with 0, then use useState to add the "++" every time for the winning player.
